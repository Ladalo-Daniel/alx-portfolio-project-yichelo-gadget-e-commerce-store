  <h1>About the Project</h1>
  <p>
      My journey with this project began with a passion for revolutionizing the way people interact with technology. I've always been intrigued by the possibilities that modern gadgets offer, but it was my desire to create something impactful.

I was inspired by real-world challenges faced by users when exploring gadgets online, the overwhelming choices, lack of personalized recommendations, and tedious checkout processes. I knew there had to be a better way, and thus, Yichelo was born.

This is the installation guide

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
